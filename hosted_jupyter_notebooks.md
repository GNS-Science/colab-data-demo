# Hosted jupyter notebooks for 3d models

## mybinder.org

Provides low spec jupyter hosting for free, and with no sign-up. Setup is a little slow but it seems reliable and has better matlab support than Colab.

### Starting/using mybinder service

 1. You need your notebooks hosted somewhere. Easist is a public gist or github repo. 
    
    In this example we'll use https://github.com/GNS-Science/colab-data-demo 

 2. go to http://mybinder.org

 2. Paste the github link `https://github.com/GNS-Science/colab-data-demo` into the form, then hit the **Launch** button.
 
 3. *wait a while* for binder.org to set up your server.
 
    When it's done you should see the familiar Jupyter notebook interface and you can interact with your notebooks.
